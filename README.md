<p align="center" style="font-style:italic">A challenging medieval-inspired modpack focused on exploration of the natural world.</p>

---

This modpack is highly inspired by the [Aged Modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/aged)! It strives to pay hommage to the original Aged modpack while also updating it to newer versions of Minecraft. While Aged focuses on the progression of the game all the way through "the End", this modpack is focused completely in the overworld. Additionally, I am very much a "builder" when it comes to Minecraft so I will be adding some packs focused on creating a consistent building palette that captures the nature-inspired, natural material charm that Aged already has.

## Status

This modpack is just being developed and still very much under construction. I do not recommend using it at this time.

Development is currently focused in the `raw-mc1.21` directory with a bottom-up build on version 1.21.1 with mods that I loved in Aged.

**Note: `main` includes my attempt at getting Aged into packwiz. Originally I wanted to update Aged with new versions but was too overwhelmed with the number of mods and complexity of their interactions.**

## Tasks

- [x] Implement Seasons using "Fabric Seasons", "SeasonHUD" and "Fabric Season Extras".
- [ ] Update the game menus to have the beautiful feel that Aged had but with my own graphics.
- [ ] Add in world generation mods like "Nature's Spirit", "Naturalist", "Terrablender", "Boids", etc.
- [ ] Add in Yung's Better Builds.
- [ ] Add in Dungeons and Taverns plus add-ons.

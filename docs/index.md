This modpack is highly inspired by the [Aged Modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/aged), which I highly recommend trying out if you are looking for a challenge.

VerdantAges strives to create an immersive, medieval-inspired world with a relaxing level-based progression designed to be realistic and get you exploring! While Aged focuses on the progression of the game all the way through "the End", this modpack is focused completely in the overworld. Additionally, I am very much a "builder" when it comes to Minecraft, so I will be adding some packs focused on creating a consistent building palette that captures the nature-inspired, natural material charm that Aged already has.
